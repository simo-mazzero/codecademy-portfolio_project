                <p>Hi there, stranger!</p>
                <p>I'm Simone, a 28 y.o. from Italy just starting with his journey in programming! I have started coding
                    very recently, and the more I learn about coding, the more I get confused about this vast world!</p>
                <p>My backgroun is in Architecture, so programming did not come naturally to me. I got interested in the
                    subject by exploring different job opportunities and getting in contact more and more with technical
                    topics. After I while, curiosity got me, and thus I decided to begin learning about programming!</p>
                <p>My first encounter with this world, as for many others, was with Python! At the beginning things
                    didn't make sense, but after grasping the basics, I discovered what a pleasant sensation it is to
                    solve a problem with coding!</p>
                <p>Now I'm interested in figuring out how the Web works, making something from scratch with my own
                    hands! That's why I'm taking Codecademy Front-End Engineer Career Path! This is one of my early
                    works, hope you don't judge it too harshly</p>
